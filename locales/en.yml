        answer: |
          Yes, this is important to us. Privacy, intimity and civil liberties are fundamental rights. More than a concern, at Quorum it's a value. Even more importantly we have to be mission driven, and meaningful in our work. And, in many cases, we don't need personal data to make this job done.<br>If data creates exciting opportunities, we have to look at those opportunities without forgetting the outcome we are targeting and without forgetting our key values. We built the company to solve people's problems, and bring positive change. Not to create new problems. Our apps use "privacy by design" principle. And we do have a legal expert in the team. Modern apps. Full Privacy.
